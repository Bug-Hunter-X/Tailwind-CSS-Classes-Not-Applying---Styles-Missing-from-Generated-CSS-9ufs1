The problem was that my Tailwind build process wasn't configured correctly.   I was missing the step of running the build process (usually using a command like `npm run build` or `yarn build`) after making changes to my HTML files. By making sure I ran the build command after updating my HTML, the CSS was correctly generated and the styles applied.
