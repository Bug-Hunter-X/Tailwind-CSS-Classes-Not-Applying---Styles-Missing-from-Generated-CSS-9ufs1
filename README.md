# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying - Styles Missing from Generated CSS

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes fail to apply to HTML elements, even when the class names are valid and Tailwind is correctly configured. The issue stems from a missing or incorrect configuration step that prevents Tailwind from generating the necessary CSS rules.

## Bug Description
The bug manifests as a lack of styling on elements with Tailwind classes. Inspection of the generated CSS reveals that the relevant rules are absent.  This is different from simple typos in class names; the classes are correctly written but are not being picked up by Tailwind.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring that Tailwind's build process is correctly configured to generate the necessary CSS. This often involves verifying the correct paths to Tailwind's configuration file and ensuring that the build process is triggered after making changes to your HTML.  In some cases, improper usage of `@apply` might also contribute to the issue.
